This app does not store your data anywhere outside your google drive. 
It just makes a folder on your own google drive and copies stuff from one part of your drive to another part of your drive. 
I don't want your data.

It's a streamlit app, though, so maybe look at Streamlit's privacy policy. I don't know what they do with the temporary data
that the app uses (i.e. the st.session_state contents). Here's a link to that: https://streamlit.io/privacy-policy?ref=streamlit

This is a streamlit app. I used the Bible tagger to generate a ton of notes, and then I put the notes on google drive.

The goal for this app will be to enable me to organize those notes from anywhere in a browser (ideally on my phone). I might even merge the functionality of the Bible tagger into this so that I can bible-tag from anywhere as well.

When it's pretty, I'll make it public so that anyone can use it to organize notes in their drive.
